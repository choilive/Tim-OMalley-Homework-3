# Tim-OMalley-Homework-3
In this project we built a random password generator from some barebones javascrip code. 
We took user inputs using window.confirm and window.prompt and stored them in varibales that were passed to the generator functions
The passwords were generated by combining arrays of the selected feild and selecting random characters from them.
See image below for and example of the working final product.
